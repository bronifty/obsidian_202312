- 3 key stages (iterative)
	- can be automated with MLOps
1. data prep (prepare raw ingredients)
	- stages
		1. data uploading
		2. feature engineering
	- types
		- streaming v batch
		- structured v unstructured 
2. model training (experiment with different recipes)
	- stages (loop)
		1. train
		2. evaluate
3. model serving (serve the meal)
	- deployed
	- monitored
	- managed

Vertex AI supports this workflow with:
- feature store
	- a centralized repository for organizing, storing, and serving features to feed training models
- Vizier
	- help tune hyperparameters in complex machine learning models
- Explainable AI
	- helps interpret training perf and model behavior
- Pipelines
	- automate and monitor the ML production line
