- volume (size)
- variety (format)
- velocity (speed)
- veracity (accuracy)

- real-time data (streaming) requires pub/sub
- batch data uses cloud storage
	- dataflow for ETL
		- bigquery for analytics 
			- bi tools
				- looker 
				- looker studio
				- tableau
				- google sheets
			- ai/ml tools

### Data Sources
- internal native
- external (eg: spanner, cloud sql, cloud storage, sheets)
- multi-cloud
- public

### Data Loading Patterns
- batch 
	- one time or scheduled
	- new or append
- streaming 
	- continuous smaller batches for near real time
- generated
	- sql query inserts or query results into

### Analytics Capabilities
- ad hoc
- geospatial 
	- geo data types and functions 
- build machine learning models
	- bigquery ml
- bi dashboards
	- biquery bi engine

> Note: 4 TB queried in 30 seconds across all machines which took a total of 24 hours worth of compute for one machine by cutting and shuffling the filesystem tables by the index

### BigQuery ML
1. create model with SQL statement
```sql
CREATE MODEL numbikes.model
OPTIONS
	(model_type='linear_reg', labels=['num_trips']) AS 
WITH bike_data AS (
SELECT 
	COUNT(*) as num_trips
)
```
2. write a SQL prediction query and invoke ml.PREDICT
```sql
SELECT 
	predicted_num_trips, num_trips, trip_data
FROM
	ml.PREDICT(MODEL `numbikes.model`, (WITH bike_data AS (
	SELECT 
		COUNT(*) as num_trips
	)))
```

#### Models
- supervised 
	- task-driven and identify a goal
		- classify data
			- is an email spam?
				- logistic regression
		- predict a number
			- shoe sales for next 3 months
				- linear regression
- unsupervised
	- data-driven and identify a pattern
		- identify patterns and clusters
			- grouping photos
				- cluster analysis

### ML Dev and Ops
	- dev
		- train model
		- eval result
		- upgrade data
		- engineer feature
	- ops
		- release
		- deploy
		- monitor
- import Tensorflow models
- export models from BigQuery ML
- hyperparameter tuning

### BigQuery ML Project Phases
- ETL
- select and preprocess features 
	- a feature is a column or a computed column
- create model inside BQ
- eval perf of trained model
- use model to make predictions

### BigQuery ML Commands
- create or replace
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `mydataset.mymodel` OPTIONS (model_type='linear_reg') AS 
```
	
- inspect what model learned with weights
	- weight is coefficient applied to each feature in determining outcome of model
```sql
SELECT category, weight
FROM 
	UNNEST((
		SELECT category_weights
		FROM ML.WEIGHTS(MODEL `mydataset.model`)
		WHERE processed_input = 'seed'
	)) 
	
```

- evaluate model perf
	- ML.EVALUATE
```sql
SELECT * FROM ML.EVALUATE(MODEL `mydataset.model`)
```

- make batch predictions
	- ML.PREDICT
	```sql
	CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `bracketology.predictions` AS (
		SELECT * FROM ML.PREDICT(MODEL `bracketology.ncaa_model`,
	# predicting for 2018 tournament games (2017 season)
	(SELECT * FROM `data-to-insights.ncaa.2018_tournament_results`)
		)
	)
```

### Supervised Models
1. use label column name or specify in input_label_cols options
2. model features are columns in SELECT clause after CREATE MODEL clause
3. SELECT * FROM ML.FEATURE_INFO(MODEL `mydataset.model`) to get stats and metrics of features from trained model
4. Model object will reside in your BigQuery dataset (similar to tables and views) 
5. to create a model, run CREATE MODEL, select type and pass in training dataset
6. SELECT * FROM ML.TRAINING_INFO(MODEL `mydataset.model`) to get training data while it's running
7. SELECT * FROM ML.WEIGHTS inspect weights
8. SELECT * FROM ML.EVALUATE
9. SELECT * FROM ML.PREDICT

### Lab
1. load data using BigQuery
2. query and explore dataset
3. create training and evaluation dataset
4. create classification model
5. evaluate model perf
6. predict and rank purchase probability
